- 👋 Hi, I’m @artursbm
- 👀 I’m interested in general software engineering topics, focusing on back-end development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and .NET, as well as design patterns and systems design
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on .NET projects and any topic related to software engineering
- 🧠 What strives me the most in technology is the impact it can take on society, while it can be also inclusive and generate changes on people's life.
